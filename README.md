### API
You might not get a response from some APIs that being used in this project due to CORS (because currently it pointing to my personal website). So you will need browser plugin to made a request to the APIs like this one: [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *]

 [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *]: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi>
